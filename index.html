                    <p>The Cruiser life! A life of relaxation as well as class. The cruiser is a bike for someone who is no rush to get anywhere in a hurry. Now, I am not saying that they don't go fast. But a Sportbike will always win that. 
                        Another thing to take into account when it comes down to cruisers is how stylish they are. We all know what a common sportbike looks like, but crusiers can be made into tons of different styles.
                         for example, a soft tail, bagger, dyna and many more.

                    <p>Now a sportbike, these things are great. The adrenaline you get from these bikes is unmatched. Another plus is that you can get a good quality sportbike much much cheaper then you can a cruiser style bike. 
                        The biggest benefit I would say the sportbikes have are the maneuverability of those bikes, the way they take turns, how they can weave in and out of traffic. These Bikes are truely incredible.

                We all go back and fourth on which motorcycles are best. But at the end of the day, we are all on the same side! We all look out for each other on the road and we all know that truely freeing feeling of riding on an open highway.
                <strong>Stay safe and keep two wheels down.</strong>
